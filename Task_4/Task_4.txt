On the forth day, I learned an important concept of function.

I learned various sorts of functions.
    @ function with arguments
    @ function without arguments
    @ function with arguments and return type.
    @ function with arguments but from another module.
    @ function from another arguments without arguments
    @ function with arguments and return type from another module.


Apart from this , I also learned different kind of Operators.
    # Comparison    
    # Arithmatic    
    # Logical   
    # Special Operators ( "is" and "in" )
